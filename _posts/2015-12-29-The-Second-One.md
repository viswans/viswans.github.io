title: The Second One

The static generator locally shows multiple instances of the same post. 
While I wish I was proficient enough to actually be able to dig into the 
internals and find out the issue, I am not. Following the great tradition
of spewing `printf` all around the place, I am just going to create a new 
post and see how things change, and take it from there. Should do something
about the fonts used in the blog. Even for a design challenged eyes like 
mine, it feels suffocating!
